In this repository, you will find two key components:

1. **Figures**: These are visual representations of the collected data, illustrating the results of various performance tests.

2. **Table Markdown**: This is the overall data table collected during the tests. The data in this table has been plotted and can be seen in the corresponding figures.

3. **Report: This will give you an overview of the project

The figures provide a clear overview of the trends and insights derived from the test results, while the table offers a detailed breakdown of the raw data used to generate these plots.
